</p> After reviewing the “Internet Basics” activity, I learned information about the different ways to connect to the internet, and how to properly utilize a search engine. Physical cables are used to connect to the internet, even for wireless connections, which came as a surprise to me. The different types of cables include telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. The wires transfer data from the computer over to a server, which is the storage space for website data. When it comes to the different ways of connecting to the internet, I learned there are a handful options including: Dial-up, DSL, Cable TV, Satellite, and 3G/ 4G. I will apply this information to the work I am currently doing for school with a DSL connection for its speed and reliability. When it comes to utilizing a search engine, the use of quotation marks can add exact specificity to a request, and using a hyphen would eliminate a word you do not want to show up. I would apply this strategy to further optimize my own research whether it is for finding a gift or looking for important documents. </p> 
</p> Once I completed the “Downloading and Uploading Files” activity, I quickly learned there is a difference between the two. Downloading a file is when you use information from the internet and store it to your computer. When you are uploading a file, this is when you are taking a file from your computer to transfer it to the internet. The best applications to use are Google Drive and Dropbox to achieve optimal results. I apply this information to my own files as a musician when I am marketing my content on social media or my website, oftentimes using both Dropbox and Google Drive. </p> 
</p> The “Keyboard Shortcuts” activity gave me insight on how to easily navigate everything I would like to do with an internet search or typing a document by just the click of a button. New information I learned included how to open a new browser (Ctrl+N) and reloading a browser page (Ctrl+R). You can also use Ctrl-N to open a new file or Ctrl+S to save a current file. I will apply this to future research, and when using Word for coursework and typing out a resume. <p>
